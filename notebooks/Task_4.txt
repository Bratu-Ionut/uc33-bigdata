Write a function that reads a text file in the format presented below, and then ensure that it returns a data frame of table content with proper columns.  The output is from a Pyspark dataframe read. How can be modified to properly read the data

To read the table from a text file into a Pandas DataFrame, you can use Python's Pandas library. The data is somewhat unique in that it appears to be output from a PySpark DataFrame read, so you'll have to account for the separators and formatting accordingly.

Here's a Python function that reads a text file and returns the table content as a Pandas DataFrame:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import re

def read_pyspark_output_to_dataframe(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Remove the separator lines and strip whitespace
    clean_lines = [line.strip() for line in lines if not re.fullmatch(r'\+[-+]+\+', line)]

    if not clean_lines:
        print("File is empty or in wrong format.")
        return

    # Extract columns from the first line
    columns = clean_lines[0].split("|")[1:-1]
    columns = [col.strip() for col in columns]

    # Extract rows from the rest of the lines
    rows = []
    for line in clean_lines[1:]:
        row_data = line.split("|")[1:-1]
        row_data = [item.strip() for item in row_data]
        rows.append(row_data)

    # Create a DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=columns)
    return df

# Example usage
file_path = 'your_file_path.txt'
df = read_pyspark_output_to_dataframe(file_path)
print(df)
Here's how to create a sample text file (your_file_path.txt) with the content you provided:

text
Copy code
+---+------------------+-----+
| id|              Col1| Col2|
+---+------------------+-----+
|  1|     one,two,three|  one|
|  2|     four,one,five|  six|
|  3|seven,nine,one,two|eight|
|  4|    two,three,five| five|
|  5|      six,five,one|seven|

Save this text in a file, and then run the function to read the content into a DataFrame.

just keep in cleanlines the numbers one,two,three... in general terms
ChatGPT
Certainly! If you only want to keep the rows with the numerical and comma-separated values in the clean_lines list, you can modify the function accordingly. Below is a modified version of the function that only keeps lines with the comma-separated values (assuming these values are in the Col1 column).

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import re

def read_pyspark_output_to_dataframe(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Remove the separator lines and strip whitespace
    clean_lines = [line.strip() for line in lines if re.search(r'\|\s*\d+\s*\|', line)]

    if not clean_lines:
        print("File is empty or in wrong format.")
        return

    # Extract columns from the first non-empty, non-separator line
    columns_line = [line.strip() for line in lines if not re.fullmatch(r'\+[-+]+\+', line)][0]
    columns = columns_line.split("|")[1:-1]
    columns = [col.strip() for col in columns]

    # Extract rows from the rest of the lines
    rows = []
    for line in clean_lines:
        row_data = line.split("|")[1:-1]
        row_data = [item.strip() for item in row_data]
        rows.append(row_data)

    # Create a DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=columns)
    return df

# Example usage
file_path = 'your_file_path.txt'
df = read_pyspark_output_to_dataframe(file_path)
print(df)
In this modified version, the regex pattern \|\s*\d+\s*\| is used to only include lines that have numerical IDs between two pipe (|) characters, effectively capturing just the rows with your data. The rest of the function stays pretty much the same, taking care to properly assign the columns and populate the DataFrame.

give me a regex pattern that keeps only words and numbers
ChatGPT
If you want a regex pattern that matches only words (letters) and numbers, you can use the pattern [a-zA-Z0-9]+. This will match one or more consecutive word or numerical characters.

Here's an example in Python:

python
Copy code
import re

text = "This is a sample string 123."

pattern = r'[a-zA-Z0-9]+'
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(matches)  # Output will be: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'string', '123']
To adapt this to your file reading function and keep only the lines with words and numbers, you can use this pattern to filter clean_lines. Below is a modified example of your function:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import re

def read_pyspark_output_to_dataframe(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Keep only lines with words and numbers
    pattern = r'[a-zA-Z0-9]+'
    clean_lines = [line.strip() for line in lines if re.search(pattern, line)]

    if not clean_lines:
        print("File is empty or in wrong format.")
        return

    # Extract columns from the first non-empty, non-separator line
    columns_line = clean_lines[0]
    columns = columns_line.split("|")[1:-1]
    columns = [col.strip() for col in columns]

    # Extract rows from the rest of the lines
    rows = []
    for line in clean_lines[1:]:
        row_data = line.split("|")[1:-1]
        row_data = [item.strip() for item in row_data]
        rows.append(row_data)

    # Create a DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=columns)
    return df

# Example usage
file_path = 'your_file_path.txt'
df = read_pyspark_output_to_dataframe(file_path)
print(df)
This modified function will only keep lines that contain words and numbers, based on the regex pattern [a-zA-Z0-9]+.
