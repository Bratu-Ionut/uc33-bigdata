Calculate how many accounts of each type there are using Spark SQL. The return type is a dataframe [account_type: string, account_type_count: int]  
ChatGPT
Certainly! To calculate the number of accounts of each type, you first need to read the transactions.csv file into a PySpark DataFrame, and then register it as a SQL temporary table. After that, you can use Spark SQL to execute a SQL query that groups the transactions by account_type and counts them.

Here's a sample code snippet:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Initialize Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Count Account Types") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read transactions.csv file
transactions_df = spark.read.csv("transactions.csv", header=True)

# Register the DataFrame as a SQL temporary table
transactions_df.createOrReplaceTempView("transactions")

# SQL Query to count the number of accounts of each type
account_type_count_df = spark.sql(
    "SELECT account_type, COUNT(DISTINCT account_id) as account_type_count "
    "FROM transactions "
    "GROUP BY account_type"
)

# Show the result
account_type_count_df.show()

# Stop Spark Session
spark.stop()
Replace the file path in spark.read.csv() with the path to your actual transactions.csv file.

This will execute the SQL query and store the result in a DataFrame named account_type_count_df. This DataFrame will have the schema [account_type: string, account_type_count: int], which matches your requirement.

If you run account_type_count_df.show(), you'll see the DataFrame printed to the console, showing the count of unique accounts for each account_type.

Calculate only the balance and the latest date for each account from transactions.csv. To calculate the balance, summarize all the transactions for each account. The return type is a dataframe [account_id: string, balance: string, latest_date: date]. 
ChatGPT
To calculate the balance and the latest transaction date for each account from the transactions.csv file, you'll want to read the CSV into a DataFrame and perform some aggregations using PySpark SQL.

Here's some sample code that demonstrates how you can accomplish this:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Initialize Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Calculate Account Balances and Latest Date") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read transactions.csv file
transactions_df = spark.read.csv("transactions.csv", header=True)

# Convert amount to float and transaction_date to date type
transactions_df = transactions_df.withColumn("amount", F.col("amount").cast("float"))
transactions_df = transactions_df.withColumn("transaction_date", F.col("transaction_date").cast("date"))

# Register the DataFrame as a SQL temporary view
transactions_df.createOrReplaceTempView("transactions")

# SQL Query to calculate the balance and latest transaction date for each account
result_df = spark.sql(
    """
    SELECT 
        account_id, 
        SUM(amount) as balance, 
        MAX(transaction_date) as latest_date
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY account_id
    """
)

# Convert balance to string type as per requirement
result_df = result_df.withColumn("balance", F.col("balance").cast("string"))

# Show the result
result_df.show()

# Stop Spark Session
spark.stop()
Replace the file path in spark.read.csv() with the path to your actual transactions.csv file.

This script will read the transactions.csv file into a DataFrame and register it as a SQL temporary view. It then executes a SQL query that groups the transactions by account_id and calculates the sum of the amount for the balance and the maximum transaction_date for each account_id.

The result is stored in a DataFrame called result_df with the schema [account_id: string, balance: string, latest_date: date], as per your requirement.

Run result_df.show() to see the DataFrame printed to the console.
