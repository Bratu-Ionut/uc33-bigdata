generate the following csv file sample files:
account.csv. This file contains information on accounts and the following fields: "id", "first_name", "last_name", "age", and "country". 

transactions.csv. This file contains information about the transactions of each account and the following fields: "account_id", "amount", "account_type", and "transaction_date". A transaction with a negative amount means funds withdrawal from the account, while a transaction with a positive amount is account replenishment. 

country_abbreviation.csv. This file contains a list of countriesâ€™ full names and abbreviations.

You can simply copy and paste these contents into individual files and save them as account.csv, transactions.csv, and country_abbreviation.csv respectively.

write pyspark code to count the files
ChatGPT
Certainly! To count the number of rows in each CSV file using PySpark, you can use the following sample code:

First, install PySpark if you haven't:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyspark
Then, you can use the following code:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("CSV File Count Example") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read account.csv file
account_df = spark.read.csv("account.csv", header=True)
account_count = account_df.count()
print(f"The account.csv file has {account_count} rows.")

# Read transactions.csv file
transactions_df = spark.read.csv("transactions.csv", header=True)
transactions_count = transactions_df.count()
print(f"The transactions.csv file has {transactions_count} rows.")

# Read country_abbreviation.csv file
country_abbreviation_df = spark.read.csv("country_abbreviation.csv", header=True)
country_abbreviation_count = country_abbreviation_df.count()
print(f"The country_abbreviation.csv file has {country_abbreviation_count} rows.")

# Stop Spark Session
spark.stop()
Replace the file paths in spark.read.csv() to point to the location of your actual CSV files.

This code reads each CSV file into a DataFrame, then counts the number of rows in each DataFrame and prints out the counts. After running this code, you'll see output like:

Copy code
The account.csv file has 5 rows.
The transactions.csv file has 10 rows.
The country_abbreviation.csv file has 5 rows.
Make sure that the CSV files (account.csv, transactions.csv, country_abbreviation.csv) are located in the same directory as your script, or provide the full path to them.
